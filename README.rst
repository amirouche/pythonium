Pythonium
#########

This moving slowly.

Recent improvements to Javascript language and the progress asm.js
startup time **might** make this project irrelevant (through
PyPy.js) but I think it's worth the trouble to continue working on
this.

Don't hesitate to `contact <mailto:amirouche@hypermove.net>`_ me if
you want to chat about it.
